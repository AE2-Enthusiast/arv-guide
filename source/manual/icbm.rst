Radar Station
-------------

The Radar Station detects nearby missiles and displays them on
screen. Additionally the radar can be configured to alert for any nearby
missiles.

Missile alerts have two parts. There is the safe zone, a spherical area around
the radar that missiles must be targetting to be alerted on. Then there is the
