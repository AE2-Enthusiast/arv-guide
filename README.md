A repository of strategies and guides for the 1.7.10 Minecraft modpack Arms Race
V.

## Folder Layout
   - `grand` is for grand strategies. Putting everything together into one
   cohesive whole. Also featured is a kinda general strategy that most
   strategies follow since there's not much variation at the beginning.
   
   - `manual` is for mod manuals describing how a mod is
   used. Things like how a ICBM radar scanner works or how to repair a tinker'
   tool. Think of it like a glossary almost.

   - `strategy` is for mod specific strategies. Things like what machines to use
   from mods or how to progress through a mod.

   - `topic` is for specific topics. Topics like ways to make gunpowder or steel.
